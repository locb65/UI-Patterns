# UI-Patterns

## This is a project on a UI element called Modals.
### The theme for this project was Studio Ghibli Movies.

#### For this project I chose to do 5 movies:
1. Spirited Away
2. Princess Mononoke
3. My Neighbor Totoro
4. Howl's Moving Castle
5. Castle in the Sky

#### The baisc layout is a simple grid of the 5 covers I decided to use for each movie. Each movie cover is clickable and when click will pull up a modal of the movie image with a synopsis fo the movie. Each Modal has a working x button to close the modal and another function to close the modal by just clicking anywhere on the window.
