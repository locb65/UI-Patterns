                            <p>Stubborn, spoiled, and naïve, 10-year-old Chihiro Ogino is less than pleased when she and her parents discover an abandoned
                            amusement park on the way to their new house. Cautiously venturing inside, she realizes that there is more to this place than 
                            meets the eye, as strange things begin to happen once dusk falls. Ghostly apparitions and food that turns her parents into pigs 
                            are just the start. Chihiro has unwittingly crossed over into the spirit world. Now trapped, she must summon the courage to live 
                            and work amongst spirits, with the help of the enigmatic Haku and the cast of unique characters she meets along the way.

                        <p>When an Emishi village is attacked by a fierce demon boar, the young prince Ashitaka puts his life at stake to defend his tribe. 
                            With its dying breath, the beast curses the prince's arm, granting him demonic powers while gradually siphoning his life away. 
                            Instructed by the village elders to travel westward for a cure, Ashitaka arrives at Tatara, the Iron Town, where he finds himself 
                            embroiled in a fierce conflict: Lady Eboshi of Tatara, promoting constant deforestation, stands against Princess San and the sacred 
                            spirits of the forest, who are furious at the destruction brought by the humans. As the opposing forces of nature and mankind begin 
                            to clash in a desperate struggle for survival, Ashitaka attempts to seek harmony between the two, all the while battling the latent 
                            demon inside of him. Princess Mononoke is a tale depicting the connection of technology and nature, while showing the path to 
                            harmony that could be achieved by mutual acceptance.

                        <p>In 1950s Japan, Tatsuo Kusakabe relocates himself and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei, to the countryside to be closer to their 
                            mother, who is hospitalized due to long-term illness. As the girls grow acquainted with rural life, Mei encounters a small, 
                            bunny-like creature in the yard one day. Chasing it into the forest, she finds "Totoro"—a giant, mystical forest spirit whom she 
                            soon befriends. Before long, Satsuki too meets Totoro, and the two girls suddenly find their lives filled with magical adventures 
                            in nature and fantastical creatures of the woods.

                            the rumor goes in Sophie Hatter's small town. Sophie, as the plain daughter of a hatmaker, does not expect much from her future and 
                            is content with working hard in the shop.
                            However, Sophie's simple life takes a turn for the exciting when she is ensnared in a disturbing situation, and the mysterious wizard 
                            appears to rescue her. Unfortunately, this encounter, brief as it may be, spurs the vain and vengeful Witch of the Waste—in a fit of 
                            jealousy caused by a past discord with Howl—to put a curse on the maiden, turning her into an old woman.
                            In an endeavor to return to normal, Sophie must accompany Howl and a myriad of eccentric companions—ranging from a powerful fire demon
                            to a hopping scarecrow—in his living castle, on a dangerous adventure as a raging war tears their kingdom apart.
